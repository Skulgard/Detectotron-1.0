# Detectotron-1.0
Detectotron UFO detector

Welcome to the Detectotron wiki!

This is the repo for the Detectotron, whose ultimate goal will be varying and adapting to reality and speed of implementation.

Ultimately i'd like an app that performs flawlessly Ã´n multiples platforms for a wide array of devices.
That app will record what moves. If the video is compelling, add feature to upload to an online public database, and/or train a model to identify and discart what we don't want. Should be pretty straightforward.

And adding support module to control a telescope mount, zoom in, autofocus ect... features. 

Any help is more than welcome i'm so fucking overwhelmed haha

Thanks!!!
